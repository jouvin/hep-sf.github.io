The Common Track Reconstruction Software Forum aims at increasing the exchange of 
experience in and share of software used for track reconstruction. In particular we would like to

  * enable the exchange of software ideas and concepts
  * share best practices
  * facilitate code re-usage
  * support possibly emerging common tracking software projects including novel pattern recognition techniques
  * provide necessary technical infrastructure to help in the development of such software

## Information exchange

We have two mailing lists for exchange of information and technical discussions

  * Detector-Technology-Pattern-Recognition@cern.ch (CTD mailing list)
  * hep-sf-reconstruction@googlegroups.com (HSF mailing list)
