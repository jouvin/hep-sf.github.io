# How to get involved

Our goal is to make every effort going on as transparent and open as possible.
Our official communication channel is the [hep-sf-forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hep-sf-forum). 
Simply send a mail with ‘subscribe’ as the subject (no content) to
`hep-sf-forum+subscribe@googlegroups.com` or register directly at 
[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hep-sf-forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hep-sf-forum)..

In addition, there is a HEP S&C community mailing list for occasional HEP
software and computing community mailings. It is not strictly related to HSF:
Everyone involved or interested in
HEP S&C is encouraged to sign up to this list. It will be used for occasional
mailings of community wide interest, such as announcements of HEP S&C
conferences, workshops and schools.

## Areas for contribution

There are plenty of opportunities for you to contribute to the HSF, be it by
participation in technical discussions, by joining one of our working groups, or
by joining the HSF with your software project:

  *  Participation in HSF activities and forums. See the Activities page.
  *  Participation in HSF events and meetings.
  *  Contributing to the [HEP S&C Knowledge Base](http://hepsoftware.org)
  *  Taking advantage for your project from the HSF (to be created)
  *  Giving input to the HSF startup team
  *  Contributing to this website

## Meetings

See the Events listing on this site for information on HSF meetings, workshops,
etc. Meetings use CERN Indico for agenda pages. The pages are open to the world,
no CERN account needed. So is Vidyo, the conference system we use. Connection
info is on the Indico pages. However should you need to upload material to the
agenda, a CERN account is needed. CERN provides lightweight accounts to non CERN
affiliated people when needed. See <https://account.cern.ch/account/Externals/>

## Giving input to the HSF Startup Team

If you are not comfortable with raising an issue in the
[forums](/forums.html] or if you are afraid that this is not the
right place for it, feel free to contact the
[HSF startup team](hep-sf-startup-team@googlegroups.com.) directly.

## Contributing to this website

You are very welcome to extend this website and add information to it. You can
find instructions on how to do it [here](/howto-website.html).

## Contributing to the HSF S&C Knowledge Base

The HSF provides a S&C knowledge base at [hepsoftware.org](http://hepsoftware.org) cataloging software in use by the community, who uses it, etc. The knowledge base relies on community input if it is to become comprehensive and useful. Please add, update, elaborate, correct entries for your favorite software packages, experiments, etc. All are welcome and encouraged to add and edit material.
