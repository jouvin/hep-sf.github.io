# Discussion Forums

Discussions and activities in the HEP Software Foundation rely on several mailing lists and forums, some of them for general discussions, others for topical ones. All these forums are open to anybody interested and archives are publically available but they generally require that you register in order to participate.


## General Discussion Forums
-----

### General Information about HSF: hep-sf-forum@googlegroups.com

The [hep-sf-forum](http://groups.google.com/d/forum/hep-sf-forum) is the general announcement and discussion forum for the HSF. Our meeting announcements are posted here, as are meeting minutes, including minutes of the startup team meetings. The forum is intended for discussion, not just announcements. And everybody interested into the HSF, even though it is only for specific topic, is encourage to register to this forum to get all announcements. 

### HSF Technical Forum: hep-sf-tech-forum@googlegroups.com

The [hep-sf-tech-forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/hep-sf-tech-forum) is the general open forum for technical discussions on HEP Software Foundation topics. Anyone subscribing here should be prepared for technical emails, so posters should not be shy about posting technical issues! Topics can be forked off to dedicated forums as appropriate.


### HEP S&C community mailing list: hep-sw-comp@googlegroups.com

This is not strictly an HSF mailing list. The [HEP S&C community mailing list](http://groups.google.com/d/forum/hep-sw-comp) is intended for occasional HEP software and computing community mailings. Everyone involved or interested in HEP S&C is encouraged to sign up to this list. It will be used for occasional mailings of community wide interest, such as announcements of HEP S&C conferences, workshops and schools not strictly related to the HSF.


## Topical Forums
------

Some of these forums are pre-existing the HSF or have not been initiated directly by the HSF but are strongly related to the HSF activities and run in coordination with it.


### Software Technology Forum

This forum replaces the [Concurrency Forum](https://concurrency.web.cern.ch/node) and widens its scope and focus to cover other aspects besides concurrency. This is therefore a forum to a general software
R&D series of presentations and discussions. The goal is to probe the lesser known, to give visibility for studies and hear what they find. The plan is to schedule one meeting per month.

- The Forum agendas are in the [Software Technology Forum indico category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/7857/) 
- The new mailing list is **rd-software@cern.ch**, which has been populated with the members of the 
  rd-multicore@cern.ch mailing list. People are encouraged to [subscribe](https://e-groups.cern.ch/e-groups/EgroupsSubscription.do?egroupName=rd-software).

### Reconstruction Algorithms Forum

The reconstruction algorithms discussion forum is an open forum to discuss all matters of event reconstruction and pattern recognition in high energy physics and similar domains. All are welcome to join the forum and participate.

### Machine Learning Forum
The Inter-Experimental LHC Machine Learning Working Group [IML](http://iml.cern.ch/) has been launched recently. 
The group is focused on the development of modern state-of-the art machine learning methods, techniques 
and practices for high-energy physics problems. The group provides solutions, software and training 
beneficial for all LHC experiments as well as a forum where on-going work and relevant issues 
are discussed by the community.

- The mailing list is **lhc-machinelearning-wg@cern.ch**
